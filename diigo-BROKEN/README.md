## Notes

- from https://www.diigo.com/tools/export:
  - "chrome" format (html) contains tags and description for each bookmark
  - "csv" format contains tags, description, comments & highlights (= annotations & sticky notes?)
  - "rss" format = same contents as "csv"

- alternatives to diigo:
  - https://hypothes.is/, open-source, with api, chrome extension displays a counter based on the number of notes (incl. page description) associated to that page. problem is that this counter include notes left by other people => good for internet-wide discussions on web pages but hard for me to see which pages I bookmarked
